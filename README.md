I have created several interesting projects that showcase my proficiency in various programming languages and algorithms. One of my projects is the Number to Letter Grade Mapper, which enables users to enter a numerical grade and get an equivalent letter grade as output. Additionally, I created the Number Count: Positives and Negatives program, which determines the total number of positive and negative integers in a given list. Another project I created is the Is Your Number A Palindrome? program, which checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not. Lastly, I designed and implemented the Box Generating Game, which is a fun and interactive game that generates boxes of different sizes and colors, allowing users to interact and experiment with different box configurations. These projects highlight my skills in programming, algorithm development, and creativity, demonstrating my ability to develop solutions that are both functional and engaging.
